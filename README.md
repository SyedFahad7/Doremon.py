# Doraemon Drawing with Turtle in Python

## Description

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Usage

```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python Doremon.py
```

3. Watch as the Turtle graphics window opens and Doraemon is drawn

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script and create your own variations of Doraemon. You can modify the colors, shapes, or add additional features to make it more interesting.
